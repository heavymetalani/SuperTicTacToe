# SuperTicTacToe
Super Tic Tac Toe is just like Tic Tac Toe, except you can extend the number of rows and columns to any number and also assign a winning sequence. (Normal tic tac toe has 3 rows and 3 columns and the winning sequence is 3) 

# Rules
1. The first player is X , second player is O, and third player starts with A, B, C and so on.. till Z. So there can be atmost 26 players. The winning sequence is prompted at the beginning and the player who gets the winning sequence, horizontally, vertically or diagonally, first wins!
2. A player can play his chance by giving the row and column number as input when the player is prompted.
3. The game can be saved at any instance when 's' is typed followed by the filename. Similarly, the game can be loaded initially by providing the saved filename.
